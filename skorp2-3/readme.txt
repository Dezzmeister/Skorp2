Skorp 2
Update 3

by Dezzy

========[SKORP 2]========

Press enter when you are in a game to get ready.

After 3 seconds of both players being ready, things will start to move. In this time, players can move around.

If a line is coming your way, the enemy will be restricted to a smaller portion of the screen. This will allow you to move around them and try to kill them with your line.
Or you can spam spacebar to destroy your line. It can kill you if it doesn't kill the enemy first.

========[SKORP 2, UPDATE 1]========

If someone dies, scores will update and a new game will begin after 3 seconds. You will have to press enter again.

If both players collide, both will gain a point. For doing the world a great favor. (just kidding)

There is a 1 in 10 chance every game that your score will be lowered by one.

========[SKORP 2, UPDATE 2]========

The client can now see deaths. The screen doesn't go blank if someone hits something.

Some stupid bugs have been fixed. Scores match on both screens, if you're in the middle YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE, and some other stupid crap yadda yadda yadda.

Some bugs still exist, but these can only be discovered by 2-person playtesting. I may have two computers, but I don't have four hands.

One example of one of these bugs is that the client's screen will go blank, and the board at the top will have a thick white border. I suspect that this has something to do with TCP, and Skorp 2 will probably be upgraded to UDP in the near future.

========[SKORP 2, UPDATE 3]========

Buttons and text fields have been made available so you don't need to edit the config file. Some buttons and menus were already present in the previous update, but they were inaccessible.

The host does not have to start their game first, but they do have to be the first to actually enter the playable game.

The text fields remember previously entered data, as long as you pressed ENTER to submit it.

And there is a wondrous button noise
